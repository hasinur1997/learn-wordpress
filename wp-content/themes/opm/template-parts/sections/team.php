                    It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first
                    morning to get them out of the flat. As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister,
                    thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister's sighs and
                    appeals to the saints as she moved about his room

                            Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next
                            morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the
                            door from the front room and looked.

                            For the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring themselves to come into the
                            room to see him. He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his
                            sister was doing.

                            Gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents,
                            Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the
                            floor did not give him much room to crawl

                            It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and
                            coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn't been
                            disturbed, as he had had enough sleep
